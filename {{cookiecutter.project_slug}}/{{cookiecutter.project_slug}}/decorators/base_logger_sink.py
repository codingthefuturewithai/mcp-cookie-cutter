"""Base logger sink abstract class for MCP tool logging.

This module provides the abstract base class that all logger sinks must inherit from.
It ensures consistent interface across different logging destinations (SQLite, file, cloud, etc.)
and provides common functionality like log location retrieval.

Features:
- Abstract base class defining logger sink interface
- Required methods for all logger implementations
- Consistent log location retrieval across all sinks
