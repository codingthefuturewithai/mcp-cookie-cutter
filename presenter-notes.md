# Community Share - Flow & Key Points

## Part 1: Introduce the Four Pillars (3 min)
**Open with**: "Everything I'm about to show you is grounded in four core pillars"

### The Four Pillars:
1. **Be Clear and Specific** - No vague requests. Precise instructions.
2. **Right Context at Right Time** - Don't overwhelm. Inject when needed.
3. **Provide Clear Constraints** - Guide within established patterns.
4. **Always Iterate** - Small steps, continuous refinement.

**Key point**: "These apply to ALL AI use - coding, analysis, images. Practice until intuitive."

## Part 2: Pillars in Action Demo (Using This Repo) (5 min)
**Transition**: "Now let me show you these pillars implemented"

- Open `getting-started.md` and `add-tool.md`
  - "See the constraints at top? That's Pillar 3"
  - "These specific steps? Pillar 1"
  - "References to `.reference/` folder? Pillar 2 - right context"
  - "Breaking into steps? Pillar 4 - iteration"
- Mention Context7 for real-time library research

## Part 3: Quick Demo (3 min)
- Generate MCP server with cookiecutter
- Run 2-3 custom commands
- **Point**: "Works because pillars are baked in"

## Part 4: Core Lesson (2 min)
**Transition**: "Bigger point - stop asking AI to generate everything"
- Deterministic scaffolding > AI generation
- Consistency > creativity
- Reference YouTube video

## Part 5: Critical Field Lessons (7 min)

### A. Technology Selection
- AI handles some tech 10x better (React > Vue)
- Pick tools based on AI compatibility when delivery matters

### B. Process & Documentation Requirements
**"Here's the hard truth:"**
- **Must have**: Repeatable, consistent process
- **Must have**: Consistent tools, commands, prompts, workflows
- **Must have**: Always up-to-date documentation for AI

**The good news**: 
- AI can help define your process
- AI can create your tools
- AI can generate AND maintain documentation
- Friction is gone - only human resistance remains

**The reality check**:
- Preference-based teams will be outperformed
- Mission-first teams will dominate
- This isn't optional anymore

### C. Eliminating Context Switching
**"We're doing 90% of work in our AI assistant"**
- Jira issues - create, update, close
- Documentation fetching
- Market research
- Creating PRs
- **Show MCP tools in action** (Conduit, etc.)
- "Context switching is dead"

### D. Reimagining User Onboarding  
- Embed AI assistance, not docs
- **Demo your UI with embedded AI**
- "This is the future of user interaction"

## Part 6: Open Discussion (2 min)
"What are your experiences? How do you keep AI on rails?"
